# AGENTS

Generic instructions for agents across projects.

## General Instructions

- **Do not ever read or edit `.env` files.**
- When making any code or config changes, always update relevant docs (for example `README.md`, /docs, and inline comments)
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested
- Update `.env.example` if new environment variables are added
- Prefer `docker compose` over raw `docker` commands when possible
- Think carefully about the task
